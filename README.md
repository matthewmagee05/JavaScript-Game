# Space Shooter
===============================
# About
This game is my first Object Oriented JavaScript game.  
You are a peaceful colony on a desert planet when suddenly you are attacked.  
Get your people to safety!


## Install

`git clone https://github.com/matthewmagee05/JavaScript-Game.git`

## How to Play

Once the game is installed, open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. 
Fly your spaceship to the top of the screen using the arrow keys to bring your colonists to safety and net 10 points.  
If you are hit by an enemy, you will lose points and colonists. 
Once the game is over, press `ENTER` to play again.  

## Have fun!
